I am a 4th-year Statistics and Math/Econ undergraduate student at UCLA. My research interest is statistical machine learning, especially the applications in Genomics and Bioinformatics. I am grateful to be advised by [Prof. Jessica Jingyi Li](http://jsb.ucla.edu/about-jingyi-jessica-li) and [Prof. Mathieu Bauchy](http://www.mathieu.bauchy.com/) in my undergraduate research. Also, I took internships at [Thumbtack](https://www.thumbtack.com/), [TAL Education Group](https://en.100tal.com/), and [onomy](https://www.onomy.co/).

My research focuses on developing statistical tools for Single-cell RNA sequencing data. I built ML-based cell type similarity trees to refine ambiguity and subjectivity in the cell type annotation and designed an R package for [scGTM](https://github.com/Sylviama1026/scGTM)(Cui et al., 2022) that uses GAM motivated model to fit gene expression trends along cell pseudotime. 

Besides applying Statistics in Biology, I am also interested in model interpretability and robustness. I conducted research in Symbolic Regression to predict materialâ€™s fracture energy with geometric features to overcome the interpretability issues in CNN.  

Here is a list of Machine Learning projects I did as an intern: 
1. [Sales Lead Score Model](https://github.com/Sylviama1026/Lead_Score_Model)
2. [Click Sequence Clustering](https://github.com/Sylviama1026/Click_Sequence_Clustering)
3. [Reddit Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling](https://github.com/Sylviama1026/Onomy)
